                    If you have been to mahableshwer and haven't tried Café Peter yet, we'd say you gotta expand your
                    horizons and find one of their outlets. We say that because having stayed in maharastra for years,
                    we
                    can vouch for the restaurant and say that it's indeed one of the best in the city. Serving café food
                    and desserts of the finest quality, the restaurant also has some Korean food options that would blow
                    your mind. We cannot even begin to cover the ambiance of the place without squealing! This is one of
                    the most chill places and as such, we think you gotta hit it to feel the young energy buzzing about
                    you. Oh, and while you are there, please don't forget chomping on their Eggless donuts - Dark
                    chocolate almond & Chocolate donut (perfect for my dessert cravings).
