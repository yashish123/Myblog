                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">Cupertino, California — Apple today
                    unveiled its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain,
                    and product life cycle by 2030. The company is already carbon neutral today for its global corporate
                    operations, and this new commitment means that by 2030, every Apple device sold will have net zero
                    climate impact.
                    “Businesses have a profound opportunity to help build a more sustainable future, one born of our
                    common concern for the planet we share,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The innovations powering our
                    environmental journey are not only good for the planet — they’ve helped us make our products more
                    energy efficient and bring new sources of clean energy online around the world. Climate action can
                    be the foundation for a new era of innovative potential, job creation, and durable economic growth.
                    With our commitment to carbon neutrality, we hope to be a ripple in the pond that creates a much
                    larger change.”
                    Apple is providing detail on its approach to carbon neutrality with a roadmap for other companies,
                    as industries look to reduce their impact on climate change. In its 2020 Environmental Progress
                    Report — released today — Apple details its plans to reduce emissions by 75 percent by 2030 while
                    developing innovative carbon removal solutions for the remaining 25 percent of its comprehensive
                    footprint.

                    Over 80 percent of the renewable energy that Apple sources comes from projects that Apple created.
                    To support these efforts and beyond, Apple is establishing an Impact Accelerator that will focus on
                    investing in minority-owned businesses that drive positive outcomes in its supply chain and in
                    communities that are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards. This accelerator is part
                    of Apple’s recently announced $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, focused on efforts
                    that address education, economic equality, and criminal justice reform.
                    “We’re proud of our environmental journey and the ambitious roadmap we have set for the future,”
                    said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “Systemic
                    racism and climate change are not separate issues, and they will not abide separate solutions. We
                    have a generational opportunity to help build a greener and more just economy, one where we develop
                    whole new industries in the pursuit of giving the next generation a planet worth calling home.”

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">The Secretary-General reminded that
                    he decided to establish the group due to a “deficit of credibility and a surplus of confusion” over
                    emission reductions and net-zero targets.

                    “We need to ensure net-zero commitments are ambitious and credible, and that they align with the
                    highest standards of environmental integrity and transparency.

                    “They must also be actionable and mindful of different circumstances”, he added, outlining the main
                    task facing the Group.

                    The UN chief recognized the independence of the experts and said that the best protection against
                    “special interests” will be the full transparency of their consultations and process.
